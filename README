## Description

This is a repo to achieve an O(n) time consuming algorithm to find
the Scorpion(one node with degree one as the tail and connect to 
another node with degree two as body and it connect to a n - 2 degree
node as head. Another n - 3 nodes are abitrary connected) by giving an
adjacencymatrix 

## How to use

First, click the node button and click anywhere in the white board to add some nodes

Then, you can add link between two nodes. To add a link, you need first click one node and click another node then there
would show one link

You can add node and link whenever you like, there is no force order

After you finished construction, you can click _Get AdjacencyMatrix_ button to see the adjacency matrix or directly click
_Find Scorpion_ to see the result

If there is a scorpion, it will use three different colors to represent head, body and tail. If there isn't it will alart that
there isn't exit
